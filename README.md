## signpdf
=======

Fork update (17-Jun-22):   
------------

New Branch GUI contains a version with Gui where you can click on the 
spot where you want signature and / or date.  After clicking just close that window. 


Orig Readme:
---------
A quick script to add signature images to PDFs, because I couldn't find
anything that worked well for the purpose under Linux.

Pros: should work with most PDFs, and with signatures as PNG's or JPG's.  It
preserves the incoming PDF's text format (e.g. doesn't convert every page to
images like some alternatives).   Just click a preview of the desired page to
indicate where your signature and date should go. 

Cons: hard coded signature file size

### Installation
------------

Install with pip:

    pip install signpdf

Or from git:

    git clone https://github.com/yourcelf/signpdf
